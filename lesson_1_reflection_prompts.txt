How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    -> git diff commitID1 commitID2

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    More freedom to recover from errors and bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Gives you greater control over how you develop a solution

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because an App is a collection of files so you can operate on a project level

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    -> git log   This will give you commit history with comments, then git diff can help break down the changes between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    This is the biggest benefit. You can try and break without worried about destroying the program. Can always roll back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to successfully use Git and GitHub for all my app development projects.
