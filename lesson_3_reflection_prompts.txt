When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Very important when you want to collborate on a project and additions come from multiple places. Also good as a backup
  strategy so that your code survives regardless of a specific machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Same reason as manual conflict resolution in merge. You need to understand what you are pulling and it's context. If it makes sense to pull
	from GitHub, then go ahead!
